        Front-end is the part that the user sees on the computer screen, and with which he interacts. That is, the front of the website, platform or system. The development of the front-end depends on 3 concepts: a markup language (HTML), a style language (CSS) and a scripted or interpreted language (JavaScript). HTML is responsible for creating every visual element on the page. Buttons, forms, images, everything is defined through HTML markup. In parallel, CSS is responsible for visually changing these elements: modifying colors, shapes, sizes, applying visual effects, among others. Both are closely linked, making it possible to view elements in a variety of ways. JavaScript is used to process information and perform dynamic interactions on the page. When you open an image gallery and click on go to next, or when you press a button that pops up a window with more information about a headline, it all works with JavaScript. Every website has to be hosted on a server (be it from Google, Amazon among others) and it is there where information is kept, such as database, login and password in addition to all systems and data processing. We at Kingly Studio mainly use PHP to program and MySQL as a database, but several other programming languages ​​can be used, such as Python and Ruby on Rails, which are currently the most popular and widespread. The platforms developed for the Web are produced with consolidated and well-explored technology, therefore, their development time is usually faster and the costs are lower compared, for example, to Mobile Development, which is made with recent technologies and the creation of different apps for Android and iOS smartphones. Unity is one of the main engines used worldwide. With it it is possible to create from the simplest 2D games to the most complex 3D games for PC, console and mobile.
